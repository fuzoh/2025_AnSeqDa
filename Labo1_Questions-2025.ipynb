    "In this labo, we will learn about the powerful time series tools with Python. In the broadest definition, a time series is any dataset where the values are measured at different points in time. During the labos, a particular attention will be paid to Pandas. Pandas library contains extensive capabilities and features for working with time series data for all domains. It has consolidated a large number of features from other Python libraries as well as created a tremendous amount of new functionality for manipulating time series data. We will discuss mainly on the visualization aspect, the data structure and the data analysis of time series. The plan is the following:\n",
